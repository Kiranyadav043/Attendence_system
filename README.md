🚀 Smart Attendance System – Face Recognition Based
An automated attendance system that leverages computer vision and machine learning to mark attendance using facial recognition. Built with a clean, modular codebase using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

✅ Key Features
📸 Face Registration
Users can register their face via webcam to be recognized by the system.

🔐 Face Authentication
Users are authenticated in real-time using facial recognition for secure attendance marking.

🕒 Automatic Attendance Logging
The system automatically logs login and logout times, calculates working hours, and detects late logins.

🔁 Live Model Retraining
The facial recognition model is automatically retrained after every new user registration, ensuring high accuracy.

📊 Attendance Report Generation
Generates daily attendance reports with:

Name

Login Time

Logout Time

Working Hours

Login Status (e.g., On Time / Late Login)

🧠 Machine Learning & Computer Vision
Uses MediaPipe FaceMesh and RandomForestClassifier with facial landmark encoding.

🌐 Web Interface with Streamlit
Clean and interactive UI built using Streamlit for ease of use.

🧱 OOP-based Modular Design
Designed with Object-Oriented Programming for scalability, reusability, and maintainability.
